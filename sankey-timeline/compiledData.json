{"name":"Napoleonic Wars","type":"W","year":1803,"end":1815,"desc":"French vs. British, Russians, Germans\nNapoleon’s success was due largely to his “inheritance of the legacy of the revolutionary army, including a dedicated soldiery, an officer corps based on talent, generals proven in battle, and a flexible tactical system” (Parker, pg. 201) as well as his own strategic genius. His downfall was his inability to control his ambitions and in his blind pursuit of glory he failed to consider the “improved abilities of his enemies” (Parker, pg. 207)"},
{"name":"War of 1812","type":"W","year":1812,"end":1815,"desc":"US vs. British\nU.S.- Britain war declared over freedom of the seas for U.S. vessels. Ends in a military stalemate with Treaty of Ghent. The United States was able to keep up with a larger British Navy by designing a frigate that had more densely-packed guns, so the frigates could outfight smaller ships and outrun larger ships."},
{"name":"Crimean War","type":"W","year":1853,"end":1856,"desc":"Russian vs. Ottomans, French, British\n“For the first time, the fighting saw the direct impact of science and technology on the battlefield” in the form of the ‘minié’ bullet for rifled muskets, that nearly tripled an infantryman’s range, steamships, which allowed the British and French navies to transport and supple their forces in Turkey with easy, and the telegraph, which allowed the British and French military commanders to communicate with their governments in Paris and London (Parker, pg. 221). In the final moments of the war the French were able to render the fortress of Malakoff defenseless by a successful attack. The secret to their success? They synchronized watches for the first time in history (Parker, pg. 223)."},
{"name":"American Civil War","type":"W","year":1861,"end":1865,"desc":"US\nThe American Civil war was fought between the Northern US states (the Union) and the Southern US states (the Confederacy) and ended with a Union victory and a uniting of the states. The North implemented use of the Henry Repeating Rifle, which allowed for faster firing at short ranges. The Confederacy used 'The Hunley' as the first submarine to sink a Union ship in an effort to break through a blockade."},
{"name":"Franco-Prussian War","type":"W","year":1870,"end":1871,"desc":"French vs. Germans\nPrussia’s greatest advantage was the impeccable administrative and organizational skills they had been honing over the latter half of the decade; “the Prussians would find it relatively easy to manage and the deployment and operations of the great armies they mobilized in 1870” (Parker, pg 244). The Franco-Prussian War saw the entrance of a new weapon that would change the way the game was played: the mitrailleuse, the first machine gun (Parker, pg 244)."},
{"name":"Spanish-American War","type":"W","year":1898,"end":1898,"desc":"Spanish vs. US\nThe Spanish-American War marked the entry of the United States world affairs as in imperial power (Library of Congress). At the beginning of the war the US Navy has a small fleet that included a grand total of 6 battleships. By the end of the war the US Navy had purchased, built of leased 103 warships, establishing the United States as a naval force to be reckoned with in the world theater (Hayes)."},

Despite Russia’s larger economy and military there were logistical issues of transporting Russian troops across the Siberia and the Pacific. Japan emerged victorious, though at the brink of bankruptcy and the defeated Russia had collapsed into anarchy and revolution (Parker, pg. 265). The Russo-Japanese War is a preview of a style of warfare we will see in WWI: “firepower dominated and killed soldiers in huge quantities” (Parker, pg. 265). The war confirmed a popular believe of the time that no nation could enter into prolonged warfare without eventually caving into economic and political pressures."},
{"name":"WWI","type":"W","year":1914,"end":1918,"desc":"Allies (French, British, Russians, US) vs. Central (Germans)\nIn essence World War I was dominated by artillery; the “killing power of modern weapons made it impossible for either side to break the deadlock” (Parker, pg. 290). It seemed that advances in military tactics lagged behind the advances in artillery technology. The European powers believed that “nations must win a major war at its onset, using every ounce of military power they could muster” (Parker, pg. 265). This belief generated the creation of national war machines as had never been seen before. “In order to fight a war of such duration and intensity, the combatants had to mobilize not only manpower, but also economic resources and financial strength to an extent unprecedented in the history of war” (Parker, pg. 312). “But the war’s greatest impact concerned the death of the belief in progress” (Parker, pg. 312)."},

{"name":"Flintlock Mechanism","type":"S","year":1775,"end":1850,"desc":"Origin:  France\nResponsible:  \nDescription:  Existing long before 1775, this was by far the main firing mechanism of muskets and rifles and pistols into the mid 1800s, being replaced by percussion caps\nImpact:  Sort of N/A since it existed before time era, but important to mention nonetheless\nAdditional Information:  \nSources:  "},

This increased leathality and saw developments of new tactics to utilize the increased killing power of the individual rifleman.\nAdditional Information:  \nSources:  "},

This was a probem for the armies of the time considering the conditions the ammo had to go through along with the weapons and men. It would seal the bore and act as the false base against the breach.\nImpact:  This become the norm for many rifle styles. Although precision machining could allow the bolt of the weapon to seal the breach instead of the cartridge, however this quickly became infeasible due to wear and tear.\nAdditional Information:  \nSources:  "},
